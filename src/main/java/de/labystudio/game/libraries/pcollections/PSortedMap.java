/**
 * An immutable, persistent map from keys of type K to values of type V, with keys arranged in
 * sorted order (according to some {@link Comparator}), and with various methods to obtain
 * specific mappings or ranges of mappings based on this ordering (such as the least key greater
 * than some instance of type K, or the sub-map with keys between two instances of type K).
 *
 * <p>
 * Null values are supported. Null keys are disallowed unless the subclass specifically supports
 * them; attempts to add a null key will result in {@link NullPointerException}.
 *
 * <p>
 * (Note: this is different from {@link OrderedPMap}, which keeps entries in the order that they
 * were added to the map.)
 *
 * <p>
 * Every PSortedMap is a {@link Map} and more specifically a {@link PMap}, but as with
 * any sorted map, a PSortedMap will only obey the general contract of those interfaces if its
 * comparator is consistent with equals. (See {@link java.util.SortedMap} for more information.)
 *
 * <p>
 * Every PSortedMap is a {@link java.util.SortedMap} and more specifically a {@link
 * NavigableMap}, but the implementations of PSortedMap provided by this library
 * (pcollections) depart from the specification of those interfaces in a few ways:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>headMap(...), subMap(...), and tailMap(...) are specified by SortedMap and NavigableMap to
 * return maps with a "restricted key range", and to throw IllegalArgumentException if this
 * instance already has a restricted key range and the relevant argument is outside that
 * range. (This ensures that map.headMap(10).headMap(15) doesn't contain elements that
 * map.headMap(10) does not, and that map.headMap(10).headMap(15).put(12, "x") is invalid
 * because a mapping with the key 12 can't be put in map.headMap(10).) This library's
 * implementations do not throw IllegalArgumentException, but rather, they ensure that an
 * argument outside the applicable range simply has no effect; so, map.headMap(10).headMap(15)
 * is equivalent to map.headMap(10), because map.headMap(10) already contains no elements â‰¥
 * 15. (This is also the behavior of Guava's ImmutableSortedMap. The JDK's
 * Collections.unmodifiableSortedMap(...) and Collections.unmodifiableNavigableMap(...) are
 * agnostic on this point, because they just delegate to the underlying map.) Other
 * implementations are encouraged to consider doing the same, and to document their behavior
 * in this respect. Additionally, any implementations that <em>do</em> use the "restricted key
 * range" concept are encouraged to document the behavior of their minus, minusAll, plus, and
 * plusAll methods when a key is outside the restricted key range.
 * <li>comparator() is specified by SortedMap to return "null if this map uses the natural
 * ordering of its elements". This library's implementations never return null from that
 * method; instead, when the map uses the natural ordering, the method returns a Comparator
 * instance that implements the natural ordering. (This is also the behavior of Guava's
 * ImmutableSortedMap.) Other implementations of PSortedMap are encouraged to consider doing
 * the same, and to document their behavior in this case.
 * <li>pollFirstEntry() and pollLastEntry() are specified by NavigableMap to mutate this map, and
 * are not specified to be optional operations. That's obviously not an option for a PMap, so
 * PSortedMap provides default implementations of these methods that simply throw
 * UnsupportedOperationException, which should be the right implementation for any
 * implementation of this interface. (This is also the behavior of the JDK's
 * Collections.unmodifiableNavigableMap(...) and Guava's ImmutableSortedMap.)
