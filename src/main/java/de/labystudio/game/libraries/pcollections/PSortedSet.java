/**
 * An immutable, persistent set of distinct elements, with elements arranged in sorted order
 * (according to some {@link Comparator}), and with various methods to obtain specific
 * elements or ranges of elements based on this ordering (such as the least element greater than
 * some value, or the set of elements between two values).
 *
 * <p>
 * (Note: this is different from {@link OrderedPSet}, which keeps elements in the order that they
 * were added to the set.)
 *
 * <p>
 * Null values are disallowed unless the subclass specifically supports them; attempts to add a
 * null value will result in {@link NullPointerException}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Every PSortedSet is a {@link java.util.Set} and more specifically a {@link PSet}, but as with
 * any sorted set, a PSortedSet will only obey the general contract of those interfaces if its
 * comparator is consistent with equals. (See {@link java.util.SortedSet} for more information.)
 *
 * <p>
 * Every PSortedSet is a {@link java.util.SortedSet} and more specifically a {@link
 * NavigableSet}, but the implementations of PSortedSet provided by this library
 * (pcollections) depart from the specification of those interfaces in a few ways:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>headSet(...), subSet(...), and tailSet(...) are specified by SortedSet and NavigableSet to
 * return sets with a "restricted range", and to throw IllegalArgumentException if this
 * instance already has a restricted range and the relevant argument is outside that range.
 * (This ensures that set.headSet(10).headSet(15) doesn't contain elements that
 * set.headSet(10) does not, and that set.headSet(10).headSet(15).add(12) is invalid because
 * 12 can't be added to set.headSet(10).) This library's implementations do not throw
 * IllegalArgumentException, but rather, they ensure that an argument outside the applicable
 * range simply has no effect; so, set.headSet(10).headSet(15) is equivalent to
 * set.headSet(10), because set.headSet(10) already contains no elements â‰¥ 15. (This is also
 * the behavior of Guava's ImmutableSortedSet. The JDK's
 * Collections.unmodifiableSortedSet(...) and Collections.unmodifiableNavigableSet(...) are
 * agnostic on this point, because they just delegate to the underlying set.) Other
 * implementations are encouraged to consider doing the same, and to document their behavior
 * in this respect. Additionally, any implementations that <em>do</em> use the "restricted
 * range" concept are encouraged to document the behavior of their minus, minusAll, plus, and
 * plusAll methods when a value is outside the restricted range.
 * <li>comparator() is specified by SortedSet to return "null if this set uses the natural
 * ordering of its elements". This library's implementations never return null from that
 * method; instead, when the set uses the natural ordering, the method returns a Comparator
 * instance that implements the natural ordering. (This is also the behavior of Guava's
 * ImmutableSortedSet.) Other implementations of PSortedSet are encouraged to consider doing
 * the same, and to document their behavior in this case.
 * <li>pollFirst() and pollLast() are specified by NavigableSet to mutate this set, and are not
 * specified to be optional operations. That's obviously not an option for a PSet, so
 * PSortedSet provides default implementations of these methods that simply throw
 * UnsupportedOperationException, which should be the right implementation for any
 * implementation of this interface. (This is also the behavior of the JDK's
 * Collections.unmodifiableNavigableSet(...) and Guava's ImmutableSortedSet.)
